I have been here for only a few months but have had a bigger impact in that short amount of time than in previous roles. This is because we operate in a decentralize way. That means anyone, yes that means you, can make huuuge impact on our mission on any day of the year. We hope this Level1 will be a great introduction to Gitcoin and how you will have a huge impact on us as members and the overall Gitcoin community.',

In this talk, Austin Griffith and Kevin Owocki will give their takes + announce a coordination tool to help us coordinate better at scale, and solve coordination failures in the world.  It's all coordination, and it always has been.",
